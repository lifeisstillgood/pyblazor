Help

* have built a docker version ??? or a version locally using docker
to do the construction??
* have got ability to run something
- which is run_docker server --port 8002
which starts up a docker instance, but mounts a volume of PWD to /src
so src/src should be


* the pyodide command in bin of the generated files (in pyodide/pyodide)
will serve the files in build dir from 8002

* If I adjust to have a new file (test2.html)

    <script src="./pyodide_dev.js"></script>
  </head>
  <body>

          <div id="test1">Hello</div>

    <script>
      languagePluginLoader.then(() => {
        pyodide.runPython(`
          import io, code, sys
          from js import pyodide
          from js import document
          elt = document.getElementById("test1")
          elt.innerText = "I am changed!" 
        `)

      });
    </script>

We manipulate the DOM from Python !
I need to understand if there is a way to launch without python etc.
